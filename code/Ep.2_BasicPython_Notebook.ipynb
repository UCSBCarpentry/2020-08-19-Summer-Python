Methods belong to objects and can be used to manipulate them,  while functions aren't. functions are in the form func(), while methods are typically called with a dot notations i.e. Object.method() Multiple methods could be string together like Object.method1().method2().method3() and they execute from left to right. If multiple functions are called they are nested. See next example. execute from inside to out. \n",
